# Rules

- Each games consists of ten **frames**.

- Each **frame** consists of throwing the ball twice to knock down all the pins

- If you knock down all the pins with the first ball, it is called a "strike"
- If you knock down all the pins with the second ball, it is called a "spare"

- Scoring is based on the number of pins you knock down. However, if you bowl a
  spare, you get to add the pins in your next ball to that frame. For strikes, you get
  the next two balls.

- If you bowl a strike in the tenth frame, you get two more balls. If you throw a spare, you get one more ball.

- An average of three games is played. You determine a 3 game average by adding
  all 3 scores and then dividing that number by 3.
